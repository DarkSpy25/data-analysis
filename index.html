            <h1>Data Analytics in the Automobile Industry</h1>
        </div>
        <h2>Automobile Industry in India</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The automobile industry in India is the fourth-largest in the world.</li>
            <li>Based on total sales Maruti Suzuki is the largest and the best automobile company in India. Some other
                major companies are Tata Motors and Hyundai.</li>
            <li>Passenger vehicle sales stood at 761,124 units for Q3 FY22. In Q3 FY22, electric vehicle (EV) sales
                reached a new high of 5,592 units. In 2021, a total of 329,190 EVs were sold in India, indicating a 168%
                YoY growth over last yearâ€™s sales of 122,607 units.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2>Scope for Data Analytics in Automobile Industry</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Data science drives product development. It is used for tasks like analysing new model
                configurations and modelling component part reliability. </li>
            <li>Plays a major role in connected and autonomous vehicles. These vehicles rely on deep learning models and
                sensor fusion algorithms. </li>
            <li>In service and customer analytics, data science improves the customer experience and
                delivers improvements in product quality. </li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2>Analysis of sample dataset</h2><a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CX_mxJ-ryiEwPfLLNfgP4B9oNtOKzU_-65Wle9363Q4/edit#gid=817598033">(Cars-Engage-2022)</a>
        <ul>
            <li>The dataset given contains only vehicle specifications and features.</li>
            <li>The lack of sales data makes it very tough to make smart predictions.</li>
            <li>The columns towards the end of the dataset contain a lot of missing values.</li>
            <li>The blank cells indicate absence of information. This makes it hard to draw charts.</li>
            <li>Some of the columns contain extra text(eg. 1024 kg kg), some contain wrong values(eg. 1025#! kg)
                and some like the emission norms column have no consistency(BS6 and BSVI)
            </li>
            <li>Therefore, a lot of steps were taken to clean the data. Isolates the most important columns to make
                smart predictions. Cleaned that data.
            <li>Removed unnecessary columns. Also removed extra text and converted to
                numeric values. Unmerging of cells was also part of the data clean up process.</li>
            </li>
